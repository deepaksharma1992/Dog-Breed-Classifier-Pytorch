# Dog-Breed-Classifier-Pytorch


To run this project, run the dog_app.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using Pthon 3 environment. Download the dataset from the links provided in the notebook

This project is an classic example on how to use transfer learning with our own Convolutional neural network. We are extending VGG16 model by adding our own layers to predict the Dog breeds.

Classification models used in this datasets are- Transfer Learning, CNN, Pytorch Neural Network
